# Digital_Attendance
Attendance is a compulsory requirement of every organization. Maintaining
attendance register daily is a difficult and time-consuming task. There are many
automated methods for the same available like Biometric, RFID and many more.
This project provides an efficient and smart method for marking attendance. As it is
known that primary identification for any human is face, face recognition provides
an accurate system which overcomes the ambiguities like fake attendance, and time
consumption. This system uses camera to capture photo and recognize the faces of
students or employee's present in the photo will be marked present and attendance is
stored.The captured photo is sent to the server, the face of the students are recognised
and are marked present.
